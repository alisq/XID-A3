<p class="openingParagraph">
<em>THE CRITICAL INTERFACE TOOLBOX</em> unfolds as an online resource that exposes experimental methodologies, practices, and tools aimed at enhancing critical thought towards the actual configuration of the Interface. These actions were developed within a year-long research project at HANGAR. This initiative is part of the European Consortium IMAGIT and fits in with the research and actions developed at the Interface Manifesto.

<h2>CRITICAL INTERFACE MANIFESTO</h2>

<ol>

	<li>
	The interface is a device designed and used to facilitate the relationship between systems.
	</li>

	<li>
	(To) interface is a verb (I interface, you interface ...). The interface occurs, is action.
	</li>

	<li>
	The interface exists in the crease between space and time; it is a device and simultaneously a situation. It is rendered (updated under thoughtful conditions) and emergent (joining into something new).
	</li>

	<li>
	The interface collects traces: traces and remains of all agents/agencies which converge in it.
	</li>

	<li>
	The  interface is the tip of the iceberg of a complex system of agents/agencies, of  interdependent infrastructures, codes, data, applications,  laws, corporations, individuals, sounds, spaces, behaviors, objects, protocols, buttons, times, affects, effects, defects ...
	</li>

	<li>
	An interface is designed within a cultural context and in turn designs cultural contexts.
	</li>

	<li>
	The interface responds and embodies the economic logic of the system in which you enroll. It is a political device.
	</li>

	<li>
	The ideology of the interface is always embedded in the interface itself, but it is not always visible.
	</li>

	<li>
	Can we make the invisible visible? The more present interfaces are in our lives, the less we perceive them.
	</li>

	<li>
	The interface uses metaphors that create illusions: I am free, I can go back, I have unlimited memory, I am anonymous, I am popular, I am creative, it's free, it's neutral, it is simple, it is universal. Beware of illusions!
	</li>

	<li>
	The standard calls for a universal subject and generates processes of homogenization, but reduces the complexity and diversity . What is not standard?
	</li>

	<li>
	Users are entitled to know what the interface hides. Access to knowledge is a fundamental right.
	</li>

	<li>
	In the design of the interface, not only skills but also emotions and affections are deployed. How are emotions produced and circulated in interfaces?
	</li>

	<li>
	The user uses the interface perform agency, they coproduce each other and therefore they have the ability to define, redefine and contradict themselve by action or omission.
